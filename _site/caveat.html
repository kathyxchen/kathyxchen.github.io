        It may seem surprising to find that, despite the alleged radical difference of the Japanese cinema,
        the same explanatory model we developed for Hollywood realist style, with its 3 axes and 3 characteristics,
        remained useful in illustrating Burch's argument about Japanese film.
        Shouldn't a radically different mode of representation demand its own framework?
        Burch is 100% aware of the imaginary status of the object for which he is "the distant observer."
        Here is the epigraph to his book:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The point is not to seek truth or salvation in the pre-scientific or
          the philosophically pre-conscious, nor to transfer whole segments of
          mythology into our philosophy; in dealing with these variants of mankind who
          are so different from us, our aim should be to gain further insight into the
          theoretical and practical problems which confront our own institutions, to gain new
          awareness of the plane of existence in which they originated and which the long record of
          their achievements has made us forget. The "puerility" of the East has something to
          teach us, if only the narrowness of our adult ideas" (Merleau-Ponty: Signes).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Burch studies Japanese film for a purpose, to undermine the sense of "naturalness" that
        the "Western" spectator may feel in the mainstream realist style, and his critique is
        first and last critique for the Western critic. It is probably no accident, then, that his
        model of Japanese film, and Ozu in particular, seems to be dependent on the very Hollywood realist style
        it is designed to critique, as almost a reverse or negative image. It may be well to remember that
        these "characteristics" and "axes" shouldn't be thought of as properties inherent in either Hollywood or
        Japanese film. They are rather, an order imposed in an effort to understand Burch's argument, and
        neither cinematic tradition (nor indeed, Burch's argument) is nearly so simple.
        As you read criticism, and see more films, and generally gain experience as a student of film,
        you may find that this nice, neat, symmetrical model with its three axes and three characteristics,
        becomes increasingly limiting. In the future, you will find much to criticize in this model of Japanese
        film practice that we have so painstakingly developed.
