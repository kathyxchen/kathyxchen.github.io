    <h1>Japanese Film as a Critique of Western Realist Cinema</h1>
      <h3>An argument in 3 units.</h3>
      <h5>J.A. Murphy, University of Florida</h5>

    <div class="container pull-right">
      <h4 class="goleft" style="color: #16a085;">Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        This presentation is designed to introduce the reader to Noel Burch's
        <i>To the Distant Observer</i> to provide a starting point in understanding
        Western critical discussion of Japanese cinema.
      </p>
      <h5 class="goleft"><u>Assumptions</u></h5>
      <p style="font-size: 15px;">
        We assume that Burch's 1979 book is a seminal work, around which the
        debate on Japanese film is still structured. Burch argues that a critique of
        Hollywood realist cinema is inscribed in Japanese film practice
        of the 1930's and 40's, for the Western critic.
        Anderson and Richie call <i>To the Distant Observer</i>
        "the most insightful account of Japanese cinema ever written"
        (The Japanese Film, they're not necessarily happy with his politics, though).
        Cited frequently through the 90's in studies of both Japanese literature and film,
        Burch's work still stands as "the most provocative study of the Japanese cinema
        in any language," (Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto, "The Difficulty of Being Radical" Boundary 2
        (Fall 91)).
        As a point of departure for subsequent literary and film criticism,
        Burch's argument cannot be avoided by any serious student of Japanese culture.
      </p>

    <div class="container pull-right">
      <h4 class="goleft" style="color: #16a085;">Overview</h4>
      <p>
      Each unit follows Burch in the construction of its object,
      though this is not a reproduction of <i>To the Distant Observer</i>.
      The material for the images has been culled from a variety of standard
       sources on prewar Japanese and Hollywood film, and a number
       of new illustrations, techniques and arguments have been introduced.
       What I have tried to retain, though, in all cases, is the starkness
       and force of Burch's original polemic, in which an unproblematic
       "Japanese tradition" is mobilized to strike at what he calls
       "bourgeois, Western cinema." Ozu, in particular, appears in
       Burch's argument as an almost photographic negative of the
       Hollywood realist style. Though Bordwell, Desser, Lehman, and
       others have taken to task these and other aspects of
       <i>To the Distant Observer</i>, it is felt that the boldness of
       Burch's original conception is the best base from which to enter
       the critical debate which follows.

                      characteristic of what Burch calls "Western cinema", which we call both Hollywood
                      realist cinema and mainstream realist cinema.

                      Examines aspects of Mizoguchi Kenji's works, which develop a similarly
                      powerful critique along an altogether different stylistic path.
                      Together, the two masters hint at the rich possibilities in
                      telling a story with film, possibilities largely foreclosed where the norms
                      of Hollywood realist cinema are taken as "natural." <br />

    <h4 class="goleft" style="color: #16a085;">Concepts & Still Pictures in Multimedia: Why?</h4>
    <p>
      Well, one, the book is hard to follow. So it's really important to get a few
      key concepts and terms down. And anyone involved in teaching Japanese cinema has probably tried
      to illustrate these points using institutional video equipment. These experiences, involving spans
      of dead class time while forwarding and rewinding, remotes with a mind of their own, and poor
      picture quality in the "pause" mode can be frustrating to teacher and student alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can conceive of this format as a series of "pause" frames organized for your convenience.
      Although there are disadvantages to still images, particularly where camera movement and shot
      pacing are concerned, they have a kind of digital precision when illustrating the kind of
      abstract notions, like the 180 degree line, and the eyeline match that are crucial to Burch.
      A slide show also has advantages over book illustrations for concepts like the graphic match.
      Whereas sequences of stills in a book are side by side, images in a slide show are projected
      sequentially in the same place, just like a movie. But I guess we lose that on the Web until
      I have time to figure out how to make the images appear in succession.
    </p>

  <div class="container pull-right">
    <h4 class="goleft" style="color: #16a085;">Finally</h4>
    <p>
      This presentation is no more than a highly schematic introduction. Clearly, to understand
      Burch's argument in all its complexity, there is no substitute for reading the book, and
      seeing the movies. What can be provided here, though, is a concrete and dynamic illustration
      of an argument which can seem daunting to beginning students.
      Once a firm understanding of a few basic propositions has been gained, the slides can
      just as easily be used to initiate discussion of the many critiques of Burch's approach,
      such as those by Bordwell, Desser and Lehman.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to acknowledge Bordwell, Staiger and Thompson's 1985 work <i>The Classical Hollywood Cinema</i>,
      unmatched in the clarity of its exposition of CHC, which has been invaluable to me in understanding Burch's point of departure.
