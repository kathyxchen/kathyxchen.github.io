        The property of movies to absorb us in a story is much discussed
        by critics and casual filmgoers alike. Sometimes described as dreamlike,
        other times as realistic, this type of absorbing illusion, where we feel
        transported into another world, is not an obvious or necessary effect of
         motion picture production or screening.

        To say that we are "absorbed" in a film, or that a film is "realistic," suggests that
         we forget about these other aspects of a film (materiality, status as a commodity & as a public event)
         and attend to the diegetic effect (i.e. its story world).

        This was not always the case. Early film audiences in Europe and America,
         for instance, were said to enjoy having the film interrupted so that the apparatus could be
         explained to them. Think of the reaction in a movie theater nowadays if the smooth flow of the film is
         stopped for even a few seconds.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        For Burch, the decision to maximize and generalize the diegetic effect of a film, rather than
        treating its story world as one aspect among many, is an early and decisive step toward what he
        calls Western Cinema, which we call mainstream or Hollywood realist cinema.

      <p class="ucontent aside">
        <i>Note: It is often argued that this decision is dictated by bourgeois norms of representation.</i>
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        The transition from what Burch calls the primitive mode of viewing and understanding film,
         to Hollywood's realist cinema, is generally agreed to have been worked out in its most
         important forms by 1916. A second important aspect of this transition is the notion of linearity.
         By linearity, Burch means two things: that a scene unfolds once, in one direction,
         in a causal sequence, and that the spectator's attention is always directed to the part of a scene
         most important for advancing the narrative.
        <br />
        As with maximizing the diegesis, the emphasis on linearity was neither an obvious nor a necessary choice for telling stories with the new film technology.

         Between 1905-1917, though, a number of ways of deploying the film apparatus were found to be

        All these devices, framing, camera manipulation, focus, and closeup, can be seen as ways to "point" to
        specific parts of the mise-end-scene. One can argue that these are effective in directing our attention
        because they draw on cognitive faculties of perception in human beings which are valid across cultures
        and generations. This may well be the case, but what is important for Burch's comparison of Japanese cinema
        with mainstream realist cinema is not only that these devices were developed to direct our attention, but
        what they direct our attention to, and in mainstream realist cinema, they direct our attention in an
        economical and unambiguous way to what is most important for advancing the linear narrative. We will
        find that this is a major difference for Burch between Japanese and Western cinema.

        Of the 3 frames we just saw, one was of human characters, one of an object written by humans,
        and the third, of an object from which a human was about to emerge. This relation to human characters is not
        accidental, and in fact represents the 3rd major characteristic of Western cinema for Burch:
        <u>anthropocentric, character-based causality</u>.

        We have already identified Western Cinema as one in which a linear narrative is represented
        to maximize diegetic effect. And at the center of this film world, we will find human characters.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        These three characteristics of mainstream realist cinema might seem to be obvious,
        or even necessary, to the act of telling a story with film. We will find, though, that this is not the case
        with Japanese film. In fact, it is precisely to question the seeming naturalness of these characteristics of Western Narrative
        cinema that Burch studies Japanese film.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        Although early ilmmakers probably didn't think of it this way, these three characteristics of Western Cinema can be thought of as
        goals the emerging film industry set for itself. Achieving these goals,
        namely <b>linearity</b>, <b>maximum diegetic effect</b>, and <b>character-based causality</b>, required a mode of
        representation that would enhance the sense of a story world while hiding production aspects of film,
        eliminate spatio-temporal ambiguity at all levels, and constantly focus the spectator's attention in the direction of the advancing narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        We will now study this mode of representation, developed in American and European cinema from
        1905-1917. It is sometimes called Classical Hollywood style. Since this style is still used in the overwhelming majority
        of TV and movies right up to the present day, some critics prefer to call it "mainstream" realist style.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        This mode of representation consists of a series of strategies involving cinematography, mise-en-scene, editing,
        lighting, etc. codified by 1917, which serves to focus the spectator's attention on the diegetic effect of a character-based
        causal narrative.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content unit" id="u1-26">
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        The mainstream mode of representation is codified in three axes:<br />
        <span>
        a. <b>continuity</b>/discontinuity<br />
        b. <b>depth</b>/surface<br />
        c. <b>centered</b>/decentered<br />
        </span>
        We will now go through these axes one by one, and show how the codes developed serve to support one or more of the
        three characteristics of mainstream cinema we outlined above (maximum diegesis, linearity, character-centered).
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent aside">
        We will begin with the axis of continuity/discontinuity. One problem faced by filmmakers in early 1900s was how to harness the organizing power of
        editing without disrupting the story and confusing the spectator. A number of techniques and rules were developed to enable the viewer to construct the
        story space and time across the discontinuity of the cut, and these were strictly codified to ensure
        a smooth comprehension so the viewer could concentrate on the story.
