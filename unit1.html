        other times as realistic, this type of absorbing illusion, where we feel

        To say that we are "absorbed" in a film, or that a film is "realistic," suggests that
         we forget about these other aspects of a film (materiality, status as a commodity & as a public event)
         and attend to the diegetic effect (i.e. its story world).

        This was not always the case. Early film audiences in Europe and America,
         for instance, were said to enjoy having the film interrupted so that the apparatus could be
         explained to them. Think of the reaction in a movie theater nowadays if the smooth flow of the film is
         stopped for even a few seconds.
        <br />
        For Burch, the decision to maximize and generalize the diegetic effect of a film, rather than
        treating its story world as one aspect among many, is an early and decisive step toward what he
        calls Western Cinema, which we call mainstream or Hollywood realist cinema.
        <br />
        <i>Note: It is often argued that this decision is dictated by bourgeois norms of representation.
        <br />
        The transition from what Burch calls the primitive mode of viewing and understanding film,
         to Hollywood's realist cinema, is generally agreed to have been worked out in its most
         important forms by 1916. A second important aspect of this transition is the notion of linearity.
         By linearity, Burch means two things: that a scene unfolds once, in one direction,
         in a causal sequence, and that the spectator's attention is always directed to the part of a scene
         most important for advancing the narrative.
        <br />
        As with maximizing the diegesis, the emphasis on linearity was neither an obvious nor a necessary choice for telling stories with the new film technology.
