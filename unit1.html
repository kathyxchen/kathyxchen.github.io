        The property of movies to absorb us in a story is much discussed
        by critics and casual filmgoers alike. Sometimes described as dreamlike,
        other times as realistic, this type of absorbing illusion, where we feel
        transported into another world, is not an obvious or necessary effect of
         motion picture production or screening.

        To say that we are "absorbed" in a film, or that a film is "realistic," suggests that
         we forget about these other aspects of a film (materiality, status as a commodity & as a public event)
         and attend to the diegetic effect (i.e. its story world).

        This was not always the case. Early film audiences in Europe and America,
         for instance, were said to enjoy having the film interrupted so that the apparatus could be
         explained to them. Think of the reaction in a movie theater nowadays if the smooth flow of the film is
         stopped for even a few seconds.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        For Burch, the decision to maximize and generalize the diegetic effect of a film, rather than
        treating its story world as one aspect among many, is an early and decisive step toward what he
        calls Western Cinema, which we call mainstream or Hollywood realist cinema.

      <p class="aside">
        <i>Note: It is often argued that this decision is dictated by bourgeois norms of representation.</i>
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        The transition from what Burch calls the primitive mode of viewing and understanding film,
         to Hollywood's realist cinema, is generally agreed to have been worked out in its most
         important forms by 1916. A second important aspect of this transition is the notion of linearity.
         By linearity, Burch means two things: that a scene unfolds once, in one direction,
         in a causal sequence, and that the spectator's attention is always directed to the part of a scene
         most important for advancing the narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        As with maximizing the diegesis, the emphasis on linearity was neither an obvious nor a necessary choice for telling stories with the new film technology.

        All these devices—framing, camera manipulation, focus, and closeup—can be seen as ways to "point" to
        specific parts of the mise-en-scene. One can argue that these are effective in directing our attention
        because they draw on cognitive faculties of perception in human beings which are valid across cultures
        and generations. This may well be the case, but what is important for Burch's comparison of Japanese cinema
        with mainstream realist cinema is not only that these devices were developed to direct our attention, but
        also <i>what</i> they direct our attention to. In mainstream realist cinema, they direct our attention in an
        economical and unambiguous way to what is most important for advancing the linear narrative. We will
        find that this is a major difference for Burch between Japanese and Western cinema.

        We have already identified Western Cinema as one in which a linear narrative is represented
        to maximize diegetic effect. And at the center of this film world, we will find human characters.

      <p class="aside">
        These three characteristics of mainstream realist cinema might seem to be obvious,
        or even necessary, to the act of telling a story with film. We will find, though, that this is not the case
        with Japanese film. In fact, it is precisely to question the seeming naturalness of these characteristics of Western Narrative
        cinema that Burch studies Japanese film.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        Although early filmmakers probably didn't think of it this way, these three characteristics of Western Cinema can be thought of as
        goals the emerging film industry set for itself. Achieving these goals,
        namely <b>linearity</b>, <b>maximum diegetic effect</b>, and <b>character-based causality</b>, required a mode of
        representation that would enhance the sense of a story world while hiding production aspects of film,
        eliminate spatio-temporal ambiguity at all levels, and constantly focus the spectator's attention in the direction of the advancing narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        We will now study this mode of representation, developed in American and European cinema from
        1905-1917. It is sometimes called <i>Classical Hollywood</i> style. Since this style is still used in the overwhelming majority
        of TV and movies right up to the present day, some critics prefer to call it <i>"mainstream" realist</i> style.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        This mode of representation consists of a series of strategies involving cinematography, mise-en-scene, editing,
        lighting, etc. codified by 1917, which serves to focus the spectator's attention on the diegetic effect of a character-based
        causal narrative.

    </div>
    <div class="content unit row" id="u1-26">
      <p class="aside">
        The mainstream mode of representation is codified in three axes:<br />

        b. <b>depth</b>/surface<br />
        c. <b>centered</b>/decentered<br />

        We will now go through these axes one by one, and show how the codes developed serve to support one or more of the
        three characteristics of mainstream cinema we outlined previously (maximum diegesis, linearity, character-centered).
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        We will begin with the axis of continuity/discontinuity. One problem faced by filmmakers in early 1900s was how to harness the organizing power of
        editing without disrupting the story and confusing the spectator. A number of techniques and rules were developed to enable the viewer to construct the
        story space and time across the discontinuity of the cut, and these were strictly codified to ensure
        a smooth comprehension so the viewer could concentrate on the story.

      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        Two of the most fundamental devices used to construct an unambiguous story space are the <u>establishing shot</u>
        in conjunction with the <u>shot/reverse shot</u>. This combination allows the spectator to follow characters' conversations across
        cuts, and through all manner of framing changes without losing a sense of where each shot falls
        in the story space. In the establishing shot from <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, we see
        Effie approaching Sam's desk.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        The establishing shot not only gives us an immediate picture of the story space,
        it also sets out what is called the <b>180° line of action</b>. If you draw a line through Sam and Effie, the camera
        may shoot from anywhere on this side of the line, but may not cross to the other side.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        In order to get into the habit of noticing this ubiquitous norm of camerawork, first note in the establishing shot
        which shoulder the characters have to the camera. (Here, Sam's left, Effie's right.)  In all subsequent shots you see the same shoulder towards the camera.
        Another consequence of the 180° line is that we never see the fourth wall. Let's follow the conversation between Effie and Sam...

        serve to reinforce continuity from shot to shot, ensuring that we interpret the glances as falling <u>inside the diegetic space</u>.

        The next shot is the eyeline match. This shot shows us what the two men were staring at, and confirms our construction of story space.
        This is a relatively straightforward example. The eyeline match engages our expectations even more powerfully when employed without an establishing shot.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        These types of continuity devices are concerned with establishing an unambiguous, easily interpreted diegetic space that allows the viewer
        to concentrate on the progress of the story. The eyeline match, by encouraging the viewer to interpret offscreen glances as occuring completely within the
        diegesis, serve to <u>maximize</u> diegetic effect.

        There is another type of device which smooths the transition between cuts, that of <b>graphic matching</b>.
        Here, the narrative center of interest at successive shots is made to fall roughly in the same part of the screen, to minimize the effort the viewer needs to pick up the linear narrative thread.

        Interestingly, in these shots, the spatial possibilities of the widescreen seem to be defeated by the linear
        effects of focusing and graphic matching, which keep the spectator's attention on the small portion of the screen
        conveying narrative information. In fact, the swift decline of widescreen production after only a few years of experimentation
        may be due to its <u>incompatibility with linearity</u>.

      <p class="ucontent">
        The effect of the graphic match is best illustrated in contrast with a non-mainstream composition. The widely divergent
        positions of the characters and their glances place the center of narrative interest in
        different parts of the screen, requiring effort from the viewer to shift attention across cuts, and sort out spatial relations,
        as in this sequence from <i>Joan of Arc</i> (1927) pointed out by Bordwell and Thompson.

        Note how the glances shift the centers of interest even farther out of line. Matching, then, contributes to linearity, by making it

      <h3>Axis of Surface/Depth:</h3>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        We move now to the question of surface/depth. The composition of an illusion of a natural, 3-dimensional space
        is essential to maximizing the diegetic effect, i.e. to achieve the illusion of a story world on a 2-dimensional screen.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        We have discussed the establishing shot, 180° line of action, the eyeline match, and the graphic match as devices
        that work for continuity. The problem of overcoming the artificuality and "flat" feel of the "theatrical shot" led to the development
        of other techniques which were also quickly codified into norms on the axis of surface/depth.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        First, one characteristic of the theatrical shot is that it is shot at a 90° angle to a back wall.
        Filmmakers soon realized that if the camera was placed at an <u>oblique angle</u>, the sense of depth was enhanced.

        Another obstacle to the convincing establishment of the diegetic world is the fact that studio sets are artificial. For example, most did not have ceilings.
        This was solved simply by not filming the ceiling. Again, while this seems like an obvious, even necessary choice,
        our study of Japanese film will show us that it is only one choice among many.

        These codified techniques serve to support the maximization of diegetic effect both by constructing an illusion of a 3-dimensional story world,

        So far we have been discussing Burch's contention that the modes of representation of Hollywood realist cinema were developed in order to support a method of storytelling that strives for maximum diegetic cinema were developed in order to support
        a method of storytelling that strives for maximum diegetic effect in a linear, charater-centered narrative. We brought up three "axes" which can be seen as choices with which the emerging cinema was faced
        as it developed its norms of representation.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        <span>
        1. <b>continuity</b>/discontinuity: Hollywood realist cinema emphasis continuity to achieve its goals of maximum story illusion.<br />
        2. <b>depth</b>/surface: We explored the several devices which realist cinema uses to promote the illusion of a 3-dimensional story space on the 2-dimensional screen.<br />
        3. <b>centered</b>/decentered: Burch identifies this third axis along which Hollywood realist cinema based its mode of representation.<br />
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        Insofar as a mode of representation constantly directs attention to the human center of interest of a linear narrative, i.e. to the part of the
        diegetic world containing the most important information for the progress of the narrative, it may be said to be <u>centering</u> the narrative information.
        As you may expect, since Western cinema [Hollywood Realist Cinema] stresses the linear comprehension of a character-based narrative, it will work for a high degree of centering.

        We know that the closeup and focus may also be used to direct the spectator's attention. If we consider this in light of the axis of centering/decentering, we can answer the question,
        crucial to Burch's argument about Japanese film, of what the pointing function of these devices is being used for, of what the spectator's attention is being drawn to.

        Even if the center of interest is not human, it is almost sure to be directly related to advancing the character-based causality of the narrative.
        The mode of representation of mainstream realist cinema is centered on the actions of human characters in the diegetic world. In other words, it is <u>anthropocentric</u>
        and <u>character-based</u>. As with many of the norms of mainstream cinema, this may seem to be a natural, or necessary part of telling a story.
        It is precisely to question that sense of naturalness that Burch takes up the study of Japanese film.

        The privileging of narrative information is absolutely critical to the Hollywood realist effect, and filmmakers use every device at their disposal to direct our

        Hollywood cinema to support linearity and the human character as the center of narrative.

      <h3>Review:</h3>
      <p class="aside">
        One way to interpret the title of <i>To the Distant Observer</i> is to note that Burch never claims to be interested in understanding Japanese film from the point of view of a
        Japanese spectator or critic. Japanese film is privileged here as an object in which is inscribed a critique of the Hollywood codes for the Western critic. This is why Burch studies Japanese film.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        This unit is meant to present "Western cinema" as Burch constructs it. What we have seen is that the modes of representation of mainstream realist cinema,
        which are so familiar to us through movies and TV that they seem natural, actually work hard to bring about three effects which we have called characteristics of mainstream realist cinema:
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        <span>
        1. <b>Maximization and generalization of the diegetic effect</b>, or the illusion of the story world and its corollary, the masking of film's status as a product, signifying process, commodity, and public spectacle.<br />
        2. <b>Linearity</b>, by which is meant that the scene unfolds once, in one direction, and that the spectator's attention is always directed to the most narratively central part of the frame. <br />
        3. <b>Anthropocentric,</b> character-based causality.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        Early in the history of Hollywood cinema, the modes of representation which work to support these characteristics were codified in three areas or axes:
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        <span>
        1. <b>Axis of continuity/discontinuity</b>: mainstream cinema strives for seamless continuity in order to enhance linear comprehension of the narrative, minimize spatio-temporal ambiguity, and establish
        a homogeneous 3-dimensional space.<br />
        2. <b>Axis of surface/depth</b>: mainstream cinema strives for an illusion of depth to maximize the diegetic
        effect, and to take attention away from the 2-dimensional quality of the screen image <br />
        3. <b>Axis of centered/decentered</b>: mainstream cinema strives to center diegetic narrative information to enhance linear comprehension of the narrative,
        and place the non-diegetic world, including the signifying process itself, off the screen.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        These norms may appear to us as the most natural way to tell a story with film, and this is not surprising since the vast majority of Hollywood movies, as well as TV shows, and even commercials that we see in our lives adhere
        quite closely to the mainstream style. You can check this tonight by watching a few TV programs.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        Burch studies Japanese film precisely to question the "naturalness" or necessity of these choices. In the next two units, we will see in Japanese cinema both a general indifference to these powerful norms of representation and style,
        and, in a handful of auteurs such as Ozu and Mizoguchi, we will find highly refined, fully developed alternatives to the mainstream style.
