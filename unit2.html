        In Unit 1, we examined a model of Hollywood realist cinema based on Noel Burch's construction in <i>To the Distant Observer</i>. If you will recall,
        we described three characteristics of this style:<br />
        <span>
        1. Maximization and generalization of the diegetic effect<br />
        2. Linearity<br />
        3. Anthropocentric, character-based causality
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        These characteristics stress the illusion of the story world to the exclusion of all other aspects of film production and style.
        In order to successfully achieve these effects, the young Hollywood cinema had to develop a <i>mode of representation</i>, which we plotted along three axes:
        <br />
        <span>
          1. <b>Continuity</b><span style="width: 80px; display: table-cell;"></span>Discontinuity<br />

        This style of filmmaking was developed by Hollywood cinema, and codified in all its major aspects by 1917.
        That it became the dominant style of filmmaking, and continues to be so today, is something you can verify by turning on the television tonight,
        or by going to any of the features at the Pyramid Mall cinema. In fact, the mainstream realist style is so pervasive that we may tend to think of it as the obvious,
        natural, or even correct way to tell stories with film. It is precisely to criticize this notion of "naturalness" that Burch studies Japanese film
        of the 1930s and 40s.

        Many film critics have tried to explain the difference of Japanese cinema with metaphors like the growth of an organism,
        or a footrace. In these explanations, Japanese cinema's failure to adopt the norms of Hollywood realist style is said to be
        due to "immaturity" or "lagging behind" Western cinema.

        Whereas this type of argument takes the norms of mainstream realist cinema as the obvious, natural, and correct way for film expression to develop,
        Burch asserts that the Hollywood realist style is a specifically Western, bourgeois mode of representation. He then makes a historical argument that
        Japanese cinema of the 1930s and 40s achieved something no other national cinema could claim: a degree of financial and ideological independence from Hollywood cinema.

        If Japanese filmmakers were indifferent to the norms of Hollywood realist style to begin with,

        We will begin with the style of Yasujiro Ozu. To speak of an "Ozu style" doesn't mean that all films he made in his long career look the same.
        It rather implies that, over the course of his career, a highly refined style gradually emerged. In his early films, a thorough mastery of codes of Hollywood style is

        can be seen in all Japanese directors of the silent period. They appeared, though, as unsystematic deviations in a style still highly
        influenced by contemporary Hollywood films. In Ozu's later silent films, though, a seminal choice appears that will ground a
        tendency antithetical to Hollywood style. If Hollywood realist cinema resolutely subordinates style to narrative, in Ozu we begin to see the gradual abandoning
        of <u>narrative density</u>. This decision is fundamental to Ozu's developing stylistics.

        Viewers of Ozu's films are often struck by the sense that nothing is happening. Ozu's films seem "halting" and "aimless," or full of "dead spots."
        These, in fact, are value-laden ways to describe this fundamental decision to decenter the narrative.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        If one finds Ozu's films to be "aimless" or "vague," it may be because this strategy puts Ozu's films directly at odds with the
        characteristics of Hollywood narrative cinema, whose mode of representation mobilizes every possible
        device to maximize diegetic effect and focus attention on the advance of the narrative.

        This choice has a very important consequence for Ozu's films that makes it fundamental to all the formal refinement and experimentation to come.
        For what seems like "dead spots" can also be seen as spaces or opportunities, which Ozu would organize with a growing stylization of editing and camera work.
        The resulting style, at its best, by treating the human narrative as just one cinematic element among many, can be seen to offer a "discreet but devastating critique
        of the fundamental tenets of Hollywood realist cinema" (Burch).

        By examining several strategies and devices Ozu employed, and seeing how each affects the axes of surface/depth, centering/decentering, and
        continuity/discontinuity, we hope to gain an idea of what Burch means when he proposes Ozu as a radical alternative to Western norms of representation.

      <h3>The Axis of Continuity/Discontinuity</h3>
      <p class="aside">
        Let's begin with the axis of continuity/discontinuity. As you may remember, Hollywood realist style does everything possible to ensure smooth continuity, so that the spectator's attention and energy
        stay focused on comprehension of the linear narrative. One of the fundamental strategies of Ozu was to refuse this stress on continuity.

        Maintaining the 180° line during shot/reverse shot has been called the <u>veritable keystone</u> of the
        mainstream continuity system. So pervasive and powerful was this norm, that manuals for film directors and cameraman called crossing the 180° line "incorrect."
        One of the most striking features of Ozu's style, however, is that he systematically violates this norm.

      <p class="ucontent">
        Maintaining the camera on one side of the 180° line enhances continuity for the spectator by allowing a number of spatial relationships to be preserved across the
        objective discontinuity of the cut. Characters will continue to look off the same side of the frame, and will keep the same shoulder to the camera. This allows the camera to move to
        a close-up without disturbing the sense that the characters are facing each other in conversation.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        In this establishing shot from the network TV comedy <i>Cheers</i>, Norm has his left shoulder to the camera,
        and is facing off to the left. The man he is talking to has his right shoulder to the camera and is facing off to the right.
        These relationships will be preserved throughout the conversation.

        Using the shoulder rule to keep track of the shots, we see that, sure enough, in the next shot, the man's right shoulder is still to the camera, but we have a
        much closer shot, which allows us better access to the actor's facial expression, from which we read the "psychological depth" so important for the character-based narrative.

        In the reverse shot, Norm's left shoulder remains closest. This may seem to be a rather abstract over-analysis of an innocent editing choice.
        The power and importance of this technique becomes apparent, though, when one begins to see that all media involving moving pictures—from feature movies, TV dramas, and comedies,
        to talk shows, news programs, anime and comic strips—will typically construct their space "correctly," in precisely this way.
        The normative force of this technique is one reason it seems so "natural."

        The next shot returns to the "correct" side of the 180° line, but shows us the mother's back. This is almost unheard of in Hollywood realist cinema.

        It certainly appears that way compared to the rigid constraint of the Hollywood codes, but this is far from random.
        As David Bordwell has pointed out in <i>Ozu and the Poetics of Cinema</i> (1988), it seems, rather, that Ozu moved freely within a vastly more complex,
        but systematic adherence to a 360° space. An interesting side effect of this decision is that Ozu needed all four walls to shoot. Hollywood sets typically only have 3 walls,
        with the camera and crew in the space where the fourth wall would be. Ozu's sets had to be made with all four walls.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        According to Burch, this systematic violation of the 180° line interrupts smooth comprehension of the story space, and calls attention to the camera in a way that distracts from the diegetic effect,
        or the sense of a story world. Where Hollywood realist style stresses continuity, Ozu systematically produces discontinuity.

        We know that one of the properties of the 180° line is that it preserves the direction of the character's glance. In this shot, Jiro looks off to the left side of the frame at Harue,
        whose wrist he has just taken. A "proper" reverse shot would cut to show Harue looking off the right side of the frame with her right shoulder to the camera, thereby preserving the sense that they are "facing" each other.
        Ozu, however, crosses the 180° line, which produces a curious, but characteristic effect. Harue's body position becomes a perfect graphic match for Jiro.

        If you re-examine the previous sequence from <i>Brothers and Sisters of the Toda Family</i>, you will notice the same type of graphic match between the brother and sister.

      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        Burch places great emphasis on the subversive power of Ozu's disregard for the 180° line. The 180° line is said to be the "most crucial component of the
        dominant Western editing system," and Ozu's constant transgressions are said to produce a "jolt" in editing flow, a moment of confusion in the viewer, as well as visual effects which are not
        subordinate to the narrative. In this way, these transgressions would seem to be undermining continuity and the diegetic effect.

        In the mainstream style, a frame empty of human characters usually carries important narrative
        information in some other way. It may be an establishing shot, into which the human center of the
        diegesis will soon emerge, or it may show a crucial piece of narrative information, such as a telegram, or it
        may be a “mood shot" invested with the character's emotions, such as a vase with flowers the heroine
        just received. In any case, it will usually relate directly and unambiguously to the emotions and actions of
        the human characters at the center of the diegesis.

        Ozu‘s pillow shots, which can last anywhere from 5 seconds to over a minute, seem rather to suspend the
        diegetic flow. As weakly diegetic shots embedded in the narrative flow, they tend to disrupt continuity,
        and direct the viewers attention away from the story. The pillow shot works on the level of linearity, too,
        because the spectator is free to scan the pillow shot at leisure, without the anxiety that she will miss
        important story information.

      <p class="ucontent">
        The pillow shot also works on the axis of centered/ decentered. The mainstream realist film is centered in
        a double sense. First, it works for a linearity by constantly drawing the spectator's attention to, or
        "centering" the most important narrative information. Second, it is anthropocentric.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        The pillow shot is a strategy starkly opposed to both these fundamental tenents of Hollywood style,
        directing the spectator's attention to a frame in which neither human characters nor narrative information is centered.

        We have already suggested that the decision to abandon narrative density was fundamental to Ozu's
        stylistic development. The pillow shot, with its weak relation to the story world, is one of the many
        strategies to support this decentering of narrative. The pillow shot also undermines anthropocentrism,
        functioning as a kind of reiterative assertion that Man is not the center of the universe.
        There are many other ways Ozu's films work to decenter the human character.

        see another of the strategies by which Ozu used the human figure as a compositional element. Called

        can break their illusionist function, thereby eclipsing the narrative value of characters, so that they

        the 30s and 40s is the dynamic tension between the banal warmth of the human narrative, and the
        static pillow world, between the still precision of the editing, and the occasional camera movement. When

        Ozu's use of <b>low-angle frontality</b> did not always work at this level of academic abstraction. Low-angle
        camera placement began to appear in a systematic way as early as 1929. Critics have suggested that
        Ozu's low camera placement was meant to suggest the eye level of a person seated Japanese style on
        floor, but this enticing explanation will not stand up to scrutiny. Camera height seemed, rather, to
        vary from 6 inches, to several feet from the floor. The constant seems to be that it stayed below the
        eye-level of the characters.

        In these earlier films, Ozu would, like many other contemporary Japanese directors, occasionally place the
        camera at right angles to the back wall. This camera placement combined with the partitioned
        architecture of the Japanese rooms to produce an interesting effect. We may recall that one of the
        strategies by which mainstream realist style gave the illusion of a 3-dimensional space was to always
        film rooms at an oblique angle. The resulting convergence of lines toward the rear of the composition is
        important to the illusion of depth in Hollywood realist cinema. When the camera is placed at 90° to the
        back wall of a Japanese-style room, the depth cues given by the converging lines are largely eliminated.

        Character movement, filming at an oblique angle to the back wall, and the shot/reverse shot along the
        180° line were all basic to the illusion of depth in the Hollywood realist style. As the 1930s wore on, Ozu
        systematically eliminated these cues. By the films of the 40s, camera movement has been nearly
        eliminated, and the camera is being systematically placed at right angles to the back wall. In this shot,
        the depth cues we saw in the earlier shot, namely the placement of objects between planes of depth, and
        the difference in focus on different planes, have been almost eliminated, though the converging seams of
        the tatami give some sense of depth.

        Hollywood realist style works to maximize the illusion of depth. Though it would be impossible to
        completely eliminate the sense of depth, Ozu uses every technique at his disposal to remove depth cues,
        and reduce the image to the 2-dimensional surface of the movie screen. In Unit #2, we have examined
        a number of strategies by which Ozu developed a mode of representation that is almost the reverse
        image of Hollywood realist style.

        <i>The abandoning of narrative density underlay stylistics characterized
        by a radical reduction of camera movement, systematic eyeline mismatch and 180° line violation, <u>low
        angle frontality</u>, and the refined use of the <u>pillow shot</u>.</i> These strategies combined to produce a mode of
        representation which is relatively decentered, discontinuous, and which acknowledges the 2-dimensional surface of the movie screen.

    <div class="content unit row" id="u2-54">
      <p class="aside">
        There are many other ways Ozu's style departed from Western norms. As a final example, we may note
        that even the stress on originality seems to be foreign to the Japanese aesthetic. Ozu often used the
        same troupe of actors, making the same basic story over and over again. This is not unusual in Japanese
        cinema, where directors habitually work with favorite actors and actresses, and remakes of popular stories are done not once or twice, but eight, ten, and fifteen times.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        In fact, Ozu's stylistics, refined and brilliant as it may be, is not to be considered out of sync with the
        mass of Japanese filmmakers of the 1930s and 40s. While a Bresson or a Dreyer might seem wholly
        discontinuous with the mainstream of Western filmmakers, Ozu was oniy the most highly refined and
        systematic of Japanese filmmakers, who shared with him an indifference to most of the fundamental
        norms of Western cinematic style.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        This indifference, according to Burch, freed Japanese directors during the 1930s and 40s to develop a
        style in keeping with centuries of Japanese artistic tradition. Inscribed in this practice is a radical critique
        of the bourgeois norms of representation which determined the development of Hollywood realist style.
