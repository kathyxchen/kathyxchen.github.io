        In the Hollywood cinema Burch constructs for his argument, everything is designed to be functional.
        Every device of editing and camerawork, every strategy of acting and mise-en-scene, functions primarily
        to absorb the spectator in the illusion of the story world. Of course when you get down to analyzing films
        things will turn out to be much more complicated, but the norms and codes of the Hollywood realist style do seem to dominate TV and movie representation all over the world.

        In Japan of the 1930s and 40s, though, according to Burch, a combination of historical factors, such as<br />
        <span>
        - financial independence of Japan's film industry from the earliest days of cinema,<br />
        - domestic film production uninterrupted by WWI,<br />
        - the removal of social pressure to adopt Western ideas under the nationalist

        </span>
        produced something no other national cinema can be said to have enjoyed: a period
        relatively free from the overwhelming influence of Western cinema. Though an indifference to the norms
        of Hollywood realist style is visible in all directors of the period, we developed the argument that the most
        thorough and systematic rejection of the "functionalism“ that subordinates style to story was to be
        found in the films of Yasujiro Ozu. Anchored by the decision to abandon the narrative density crucial to
        Hollywood realist cinema, Ozu was able to organize a style in which discontinuity, decentering, and 2-dimensional composition enter into a dialectical play with the simple family dramas he repeated in film after film.

        Unit 3 will elaborate the systemics of Mizoguchi Kenji. Mizoguchi's films, with their dramatic stories of art, exploitation, madness and sacrifice, seem worlds away from the domestic banality of Ozu’s family drama.

        Mizoguchi's style too, characterized by <i>the long shot, complicated camera movement, exceptionally long
        takes, and a rejection of editing in general</i>, seems almost diametrically opposed to the Ozu style. And yet,
        these two masters converge in the critique they offer the Hollywood realist style.

        Mizoguchi did not abandon narrative density like Ozu, and his stories are as exciting, romantic and
        sensational as any Hollywood product. What makes his style converge with Ozu's as a critique of the
        Western mode, though, is that formally he did not center that narrative. In fact, Mizoguchi's style
        questions all three fundamental characteristics of Hollywood realist style, privileging neither linearity, nor
        diegetic effect, nor the human characters as center of the diegetic world.

        What Ozu and Mizoguchi may be said to share in their stylistic development over the 30s and 40s is the
        abandonment of the <i>dramatic functionalism</i> that underlay Western cinema. By <i>dramatic
        functionalism</i>, we mean that every aspect of film style and production in Hollywood cinema "functions"
        to support the easy comprehension of a story world. That Mizoguchi and Ozu developed these alternative
        strategies along altogether different stylistic paths is testament to the extraordinary possibilities inherent
        in the cinematic medium, possibilities largely foreclosed where Hollywood realist style is taken as a norm.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        Even more than in the case of Ozu, to understand the beauty and rigor of Mizoguchi's style you must see
        the films. The long takes, complex camera movement, and rejection of editing which characterize his
        style are not well-suited to slide presentation. In this unit, we will examine just a few of Mizoguchi's
        strategies, such as the <i>long shot</i>, and the construction of <i>3-dimensional space</i>. By examining how these
        strategies  <i>decenter</i> the human story world, and bring to the foreground other aspects of film art, in a way
        quite different from Ozu's, we continue to emphasize that Hollywood realist style is neither obvious nor
        natural, but just one way among many to tell a story with film.

      <h3>The Long Shot</h3>
      <p class="ucontent">
        A preponderance of long-shots and medium long-shots is one of the fundamental traits of Japanese
        cinema in the 30s and 40s. Mizoguchi, in particular, avoided the closeup, habitually placing his camera
        far from the characters. The long-shot is also found in the Hollywood realist style, but, since at least
        1910, had been codified as an establishing shot, to be invariably followed by a dolly-in, or cut to medium
        close-up or close-up.

      <span class="fcite"><i>Zangiku Monogatari</i> (1939) (DO 233)</span>
      <p class="ucontent">
        Mizoguchi, however, maintained his distance. Even at moments of great poignancy or dramatic intensity,
        where the Hollywood realist style would invariably move in for a close-up, Mizoguchi's composition will
        remain in long-shot. In these shots from <i>The Tale of Last Chrysanthemums</i>, for example, the protagonist
        has been ordered by his father to stop seeing the nursemaid he is in love with. His mother begs him to
        accede to his father's wishes, and then the family listens in horror as he refuses, and is disowned by the
        father.

        In these three frames, the camera makes no adjustment for the changing emotional intensity of the
        human narrative. Students often find it difficult to empathize with the characters in these films, because
        the norms of Hollywood realist cinema teach us to expect that moments of dramatic intensity will be
        clearly marked by devices like the closeup and swelling violin music.

      <p class="ucontent">
        It has been suggested that Mizoguchi simply reversed the codes. According to this argument, pulling back
        to long-shot at moments of dramatic intensity would mark the rise in emotional intensity just as
        effectively as the closeup. They are both, in other words, arbitrary markers. Let's see how this works in a
        scene from <i>Osaka Elegy</i>. Here the merchant Fujino is propositioning Ayako in a restaurant.

      <span class="fcite"><i>Naniwa Erejii</i> (1936) extended long shot of struggle</span>
      <p class="ucontent">
        The camera then pulls back to an extreme long-shot of the ensuing struggle. Such  a “reverse-coding” is
        thought to be equivalent to the close-up in Hollywood realist norms because simply reversing the terms in
        a binary relation does not affect the signifying relationship. The problem with this argument is that it
        assumes that the long-shot and closeup are stylistic elements of equal value. In other words, this
        argument ignores the "pointing" function of the closeup, and its relation to linear comprehension.

      <p class="ucontent">
        The use of the closeup or medium closeup at moments of dramatic intensity is not an arbitrary choice. It
        is a choice closely tied to the Hollywood realist style's emphasis on linear comprehension of the
        character-centered narrative.

      <p class="ucontent">
        The closeup does not just neutrally “mark" the modulations in emotional intensity of a film. In addition to
        this function, it insistently “points” to the human character as a source of these emotions. By eliminating
        extraneous cues, it focuses the viewer's attention, and by bringing the camera closer it encourages us to
        read psychological depth from the facial expression of the actor or actress.

      <p class="ucontent">
        The long shot does not insistently direct the spectator's attention like a closeup, and so does not privilege
        linearity in the same way. It also does not give us a privileged vantage point on the character's facial
        expression, either, and so does not privilege character psychology like Hollywood realist style. An example
        of a non-linear use of the closeup can make this clearer.

      <p class="ucontent">
        In this shot, Mizoguchi uses the pointing function of the closeup in a way that is not insistently linear. The
        first closeup of Taki no Shiraito takes place over an hour into the film, and directs the viewer's attention,
        not to an intensely melodramatic moment, but to an old woman who is a marginal character, and the
        shot occurs during a lull in dramatic intensity.

        Mizoguchi's use of camera distance, then, works against both the centering effects of Hollywood realist
        style: <b>anthropocentrism</b> and <b>linearity</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        <b>Anthropocentrism</b>, in particular, is a number of other camera strategies, such asymmetrical framing and the refusal of “reframing” when characters move about. The composition of
        this frame, for example, would violate the Hollywood codes both by being off-center and by the
        inordinate amount of space over the heads of the characters.

      <p class="ucontent">
        In this shot, Hollywood realist style would dictate that the camera be "nudged" upward to keep the
        character's face within the frame. The cameraman is tasked with constantly maintaining the optimum
        vantage point on the activities of the human characters, and you will find that, in a Hollywood realist film
        the camera will be unobtrusively nudged to keep the character’s faces centered in the frame. Mizoguchi’s films of the 30s and 40s, though,
        show a remarkable indifference to this, and when a character stands
        up or moves, they may be cut off by the edge of the frame, or leave the frame entirely.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        We have been discussing a number of ways that Mizoguchi's style is profoundly decentered. The
        systematically non-linear use of camera distance and framing is one way that this style offers an
        alternative to Hollywood realist style's resolute centering of the human diegesis.

      <h3>The Construction of Space</h3>
      <p class="ucontent">
        We turn now to the construction of space. In watching a movie, the spectator is shown a series of
        photographs of a 3-dimensional world, but these are projected on a 2-dimensional screen. When we talk
        about the axis of Surface/Depth, we mean that the spectator's experience of narrative space will fall
        somewhere between this illusion of a fully present 3-dimensional world, and full acknowledgement of the
        two-dimensional quality of the movie screen. It is important to note that depth is not a natural property of the film image,
        but a carefully achieved effect. Hollywood realist cinema does everything possible to
        create this illusion of 3-dimensional space.

      <p class="ucontent">
        Ozu's style, on the other hand, rigorously eliminated depth cues to stress the 2-dimensional nature of
        the movie screen. Japanese cinema, in general, is much less concerned with the maximization of diegetic
        effect, and so can allow the presence of the camera, and the 2-dimensionality of the screen to assert
        itself.

        There are a number of aspects of Mizoguchi's style, though, that inevitably enhance the <i>illusion of 3-dimensional space</i>.
        For example, his tendency to film from a high angle emphasizes depth cues that Ozu’s
        low-angle eliminates. In this shot, the receding planes of the Japanese architecture are clearly
        differentiated, and the human characters are unambiguously located in depth. The lines of the shoji
        screen and tatami floor are also allowed to converge toward the back of the frame, creating additional
        perspectival cues.

      <p class="ucontent">
        Another aspect is the highly mobile camera Mizoguchi employs during his extreme|y long takes. This is a
        signature of his style, and inevitably provides the spectator with cues for the perception of depth. As the

      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        the shifting orientation to the back walls and constantly changing relative position of the objects in the
        frame, all enhance the illusion of <u>depth</u>. In this respect, Mizoguchi's style is altogether different from
        Ozu's. We might conclude, then, that since Mizoguchi's style creates the illusion of depth, it is closer to
        the Western style in this respect.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        We have already mentioned, though, that what makes Mizoguchi's style compatible with Ozu's is its
        rejection of the functionalism of Hollywood realist cinema. In Hollywood realist style, 3-dimensional space
        is important because it functions to maximize the diegetic effect.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        The 3-dimensional space constructed by Mizoguchi, though, is not the illusory space of the story world,
        But a movie space, and the presence of the camera and the sets, and by implication the filmmakers,
        is not hidden. This is why it constitutes both an alternative and a critique of the Hollywood realist style. We
        will next examine a number of ways in which this fully 3-dimensional space is rendered as only partially
        diegetic.

      <p class="ucontent">
        First, Mizoguchi does not hide the fact that a movie set is a construction. We remember that the set for a
        Hollywood movie typically only has 3 walls, and that one of the functions of the 180° line is to prevent the
        camera from filming the absent 4th wall. Ozu, who filmed in 360° space, had his technicians specially construct sets with all 4 walls.
        These techniques allow the spectator to imagine that the set is a real
        room. What's more, both of these styles avoid filming the ceiling of a set, thereby hiding its absence.
        Mizoguchi, though, continually reveals his sets to be just that, movie sets. His highly mobile camera, for
        example, will often catch a set partition, and extremely high angles, like this shot from <i>Taki no Shiraito</i>,
        draw attention to the camera’s presence, and emphasize the absence of a ceiling.

        Mizoguchi's camera movement itself asserts the camera’s presence in a way that the "following shot"
        and the expressive dolly-in of the Western style do not. The weaving and circling, rising and falling of the camera during his extremely long takes, do not relate
        directly to any change in character emotions or
        position, and so take on their own beauty, divorced from any subservience to narrative function. This is
        best illustrated, though, by “moving” pictures, so we will skip to the next way in which Mizoguchi
        decenters his 3-dimensional space.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        The eyeline match, as you will recall, is a keystone of the continuity system. This device teaches us to
        expect that a character's off-screen look falls within the story world, and will always be followed by a
        satisfying shot of what was being looked at. The anthropocentric Hollywood style adds the stipulation
        that the eyeline match will also be a point-of-view shot. In other words, it will not only show us what the
        character is locking at, but show it as if seen from the character's eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        Mizoguchi, while giving us correct eyeline matches, may partially "decenter" them by <u>refusing the point-of-view</u>

        Mizoguchi's characteristic high angle long-shots in a startling manner, this shot seems to place the deity
        in its own, non-human world. The convention of the eyeline match, though, and the slight upward glance
        of the statue humorously reconnect the shot to the diegetic world.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        The space of Hollywood realist film is the absorbing space of the story world. In Mizoguchi's style, on the
        other hand, all these strategies, (making set partitions visible, bravura camera work, non-POV eyeline
        matches) construct a 3-dimensional space that includes the process of movie production.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        This is not the only way Mizoguchi frees his construction of space from subordination to the diegetic
        effect. Another kind of space that seemed to interest Mizoguchi throughout his career is neither diegetic,
        nor movie space. This is the space of the emaki, or <b>picture scroll</b>.

      <div class="longer">
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        The <b>emaki</b> is a form of story illustration dating from the Heian period, consisting of a long, horizontal
        scroll, on which pictures and text, representing scenes from a story are painted in succession. Emaki were
        unrolled in front of an audience, and the pictures referred to in succession, both to illustrate the story, and
        to help the storyteller remember important events.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        Mizoguchi often creates a self-conscious allusion to the horizontal process of reading the emaki by long
         horizontal tracking shots. In <i>The Story of Last Chrysanthemums</i> (1939), for example, he sets the camera
        below road level in a city street, and follows two characters for 7 minutes as they walk and talk. The
        buildings and street vendors pass by as if being unrolled from a great scroll. Opening credits, too, are
        often filmed by passing the camera over a horizontal scroll, rather than rolling the characters vertically by.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent-longer">
        These tracking shots, though, since they pass over a continuously unfolding scenery, do not really
        capture the compartmentalized character of the emaki, which presents a series of discrete scenes. At
        other times, though, he approaches closer to rigorously employing the discrete space of the emaki. In this
        scene from <i>Osaka Elegy</i>, for example, Ayako's boyfriend is being interrogated at police headquarters, a
        reinforced concrete building.

      <p class="ucontent">
        She is being simultaneously interrogated in the next room, and the camera begins to track left, bringing
        the set partition into view. Hollywood realist norms would dictate that this scene be done by suspenseful
        intercutting, to give the illusion of simultaneous action. Mizoguchi, though, works for an emaki space by
        passing the camera <i>in front of</i> the set partition. Here, the camera is moving from right to left, with the
        wall partition visible near the boyfriend's chair.

      <span class="fcite"><i>Naniwa Erejii</i> (1936) (2nd interrogation scene)</span>
      <p class="ucontent">
        The effect is to make us aware of this shot as two separate scenes inscribed on the same “scroll.” More
        than the more self-consciously elegant evocations of the emaki in his postwar films, this rigorously
        achieves the sequential, compartmentalized quality that defines emaki space.
      </p>
      <p class="ucontent">
        The exposure of the set partition interrupts the diegetic illusion that this scene is taking place in a solid building.
        But the exposure of the partition also recalls a second convention of emaki space: the <i>cutaway view</i>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content unit row" id="u3-30">

      <span class="fcite"><i>Makura no Soshi no Emaki</i> (Late Heian, cutaway shot through the roof)</span>
      <p class="ucontent">
        Emaki representation often positions the viewer outside the architectural space. Typically, the roof is cut
        away to reveal the scene from a very high angle. We may recall that the set of a Hollywood film typically
        did not have ceilings, and that the realist norms dictated the "natural" solution of this problem: They
        simply did not film the ceiling. Ozu's films as well, respected this convention.

      <span class="fcite"><i>Taki no Shiraito</i> (1933) (love scene from normal angle)</span>
      <p class="ucontent">
        Mizoguchi's unconstrained use of the 3-dimensional space of the movie set, though, allows him to use this
        emaki-like convention to beautiful effect. In this scene, Taki no Shiraito has invited the young Kinya back
        to her room, and made an agreement to pay his way through law school.

      <span class="fcite"><i>Taki no Shiraito</i> (1933) (cut to high angle)</span>
      <p class="ucontent">
        As she retires behind the folding screen to seduce the young man, the camera cuts to a high-angIe,
        "through the roof" shot, which strongly recalls emaki illustrating famous medieval romances. This type of
         cut is sometimes cited as evidence that Mizoguchi coded the long shot for dramatic intensity. We have
        already discussed shortcomings in this argument. It seems more in keeping with Mizoguchi's
        heterogeneous construction of space, though, to see the cut as shifting this erotically charged moment
        to the aestheticized space of the emaki.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="content unit row" id="u3-33">
      <p class="aside">
        We have examined a number of characteristics of Mizoguchi's style, including the <u>refusal of the closeup</u>,
        and <u>reframing</u>, as well as the <u>construction of a fully 3-dimensional</u>, but only <u>partially diegetic space</u>, and
        the citation of <u>emaki-space</u>. We have also discussed the <u>long take</u> and the <u>mobile camera</u>, though we
        couldn't illustrate them with slides.
      </p>
      <p class="aside">
        In terms of the 3 axes of representation, these devices move Mizoguchi's style toward the poles of
        continuity, and depth. At first glance, this would seem to be more compatible with Hollywood realist style
        than with the style of Ozu. The altogether different stylistic paths of Ozu and Mizoguchi, though,
        converge in their refusal to subordinate stylistics to the illusion of the story world. This results in a
        resolutely decentered effect that is both a critique, and an alterative to the realist style we often take to be the “natural,” or even correct way to tell stories with film. That Mizoguchi and Ozu could offer
         alternatives so strikingly different, and do so in movies that had wide popular appeal, is testimony both to
        the richness of Japanese cinema in the 1930s and 40s, and the self-imposed limitations of the
        Hollywood realist style.
